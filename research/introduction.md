## Research Page

My research interests lie at the interaction between biology, cognitive science, and computing. Specifically, I am interested in a range of computer models of biological phenomena, especially those applied to imitating intelligent or lifelike behaviors. In many of these areas of research, evolutionary algorithms are utilized, which imitate key elements of the process of biological evolution. Such elements include as mutation, selection, and inheritance across a population of individuals. For more about evolutionary algorithms please see these links:
