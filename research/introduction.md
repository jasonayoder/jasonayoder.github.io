My research interests lie at the interaction between biology, cognitive science, and computing. Specifically, I am interested in a range of computer models of biological phenomena, especially those applied to imitating intelligent or lifelike behaviors. In many of these areas of research, evolutionary algorithms are utilized, which imitate key elements of the process of biological evolution. Such elements include as mutation, selection, and inheritance across a population of individuals. For more about evolutionary algorithms please see these links:

My research interests lie in the interaction between biology, cognitive science, and computing. Specifically, I am interested in a range of computer models of biological phenomena, especially those applied to imitating intelligent or lifelike behaviors. In many of these areas of research, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are utilized, which imitate key elements of the process of biological evolution. Such elements include as mutation, selection, and inheritance across a population of individuals. For more about evolutionary algorithms please see these links:

In the course CSSE220, there is an option for a final project in which you create your own Genetic Algorithm simulator which you can use to try to evolve solutions to problems as encoded as bitstrings (sequences of 1s and 0s).Several students who chose to work on this project later pursued research with me in related areas. If you have not yet taken CSSE220, I would strongly encourage you to consider selecting the GARP (Genetic Algorithm Research Project) when you do, if you are interested in any of these areas.

As for the currently active projects, these are two which have been most active recently:

1. Modeling Evolutionary Development on NK Fitness-Landscapes
Attempts to study complex phenomena such as evolution which occur over vast scales of space and time can be very challenging. Using computer models affords the ability to explore the implications of simple sets of assumptions and provides a computational proof of concept for how interacting parts can produce complex, emergent behaviors. Historically and more recently, there have been attempts to explore the interactions between different complex phenomena such as learning and evolution, which has implications both in our understanding of the natural world, but also for applications in fields such as artificial intelligence. For the past two years I have worked with teams of students to develop an abstract model which explores the interactions between development, learning, and evolution. Development is the process of an organism growing and maturing from a single cell into an adult form. Development is critical in guiding not only the formation of a body, but of a brain, and hence learning and behavior as well. Work on this model has been published and presented at the International Artificial Life conference for the past two years. Our model can be understood as evolving developmental programs which regulate the behavior of agents exploring an abstract fitness landscape. The fitness landscape model we have used is the NK model, which has two tunable parameters which adjust the relative size (N) and ruggedness (K) of the space to be explored. There are a number of potential future directions and a mature codebase that should help accelerate progress this year!

You may want to consider this project if:
You are interested in understanding and studying biological processes such as evolution, learning, and development
You would like to explore theoretical ideas about how biological processes operate and interact
You have an interest in applying theories and ideas from biology to try to create intelligent systems
Technologies:
The current model is coded in Java, but Python libraries are used for data visualization.

2. Evolvable Hardware
Research in the late 1990s by Adrian Thompson demonstrated an application of evolutionary algorithms to explore the use of reconfigurable computer hardware (field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)) to approach computing in a fundamentally different from conventional human design. Instead of designing circuits, circuits were evolved in silico, to produce desirable behaviors. Among the most impressive results of this line of research was the creation of a tone discriminator which could accurately classify 1K and 10K signals without the use of a clock. Not only was it successful, but the evolved solution used very few components compared with the best human designs of the time. This research was largely discontinued for nearly twenty years largely due to a discontinuation of the open documentation of the hardware bitstream of available FPGA devices. Recently, however, I have collaborated with a Ph.D. candidate (Derek Whitely) at Indiana University and Rose-Human students to reignite interest in this area. The current RH student team has been working to greatly improve the quality and capabilities of the open-source codebase. There are many challenges and opportunities for future work and direction in this project!

Technologies:
The current codebase is primarily written in Python, but if you are interested there is also room for work to be done in Arduino code, and tinkering with the FPGA bitstream code (Verilog).
